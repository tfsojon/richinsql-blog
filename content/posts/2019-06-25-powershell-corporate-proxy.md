I have been having a problem at work where when I try to either install or update a module on my work laptop I get the following error message.

A quick Google of the error will return a plethora of information on [how to fix](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14263359/access-web-using-powershell-and-proxy) the issue, with the main focus being on the following two lines;

```
    $webclient=New-Object System.Net.WebClient
    $webclient.Proxy.Credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials
```

For the majority of people, this seemed to resolve the issue and they could go about there business, for me however it didn&#8217;t resolve the problem, at least it wasn&#8217;t the sole fix.

#### Offline Installer

I had a little bit of time this morning so I thought I would have a go at Installing dbatools using the offline method, I loaded up PowerShell and typed the command

```
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri powershellgallery.com/api/v2/package/dbatools -OutFile c:\temp\dbatools.zip
```

However, I was presented with the following.

What actually appeared to be happening was [powershellgallery.com](https://www.powershellgallery.com/) had been blocked by an upstream web proxy policy, I requested that [powershellgallery.com](https://www.powershellgallery.com/)/* be white listed for the admin team, waited a little while and tried again.

Wallah, it works now. I still need the two magic lines of code, which are in my PowerShell profile now.

Hopefully this helps someone else.
