Recently I was asked to look into the possibility of encrypting some of the column level data that is held within a SQL Server instance, not knowing where to start and not running SQL Server 2017 I set about looking for options, one of which was to use Symmetric Keys & Certificates to encrypt the data and in this post I am going to demonstrate how I did that and what I learned.

First up I created a table that would potentially hold sensitive information I could use for demonstration purposes.

<pre>     
	<code class="sql">
		USE EncryptionTest
		CREATE TABLE Patients
		(
		PatientID INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
		PatientNumber varchar(100),
		PatientNumber_Encrypted VARBINARY(MAX) NULL,
		NHSNumber varchar(12),
		NHSNumber_Encrypted VARBINARY(MAX) NULL,
		Forename varchar(50),
		Forename_Encrypted VARBINARY(MAX) NULL,
		Surname varchar(50),
		Surname_Encrypted VARBINARY(MAX)
		);
	</code>
</pre>

In this example, I am going to make use of Patients. _(None of the data used in this example is real)_

<pre>     
	<code class="sql">
		USE EncryptionTest
		GO
		CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'StrongPassword1234!!';
		GO
	</code>
</pre>

I created a master key within the database, using a strong password, recording this somewhere safe is mandatory else the data will be lost.

<pre>     
	<code class="sql">
		USE EncryptionTest
		CREATE CERTIFICATE Cert1 WITH SUBJECT = 'Protect it all';
		GO
	</code>
</pre>

I needed a self-signed certificate to secure all the data with.

<pre>     
	<code class="sql">
		USE EncryptionTest
		GO
		CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY Key1 WITH ALGORITHM = AES_128 ENCRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE Cert1;
		GO
	</code>
</pre>

Once I had created the master key and certificate I could go ahead and build up the [Symmetric Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-symmetric-key-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017)

### Inserting Some Data

<pre>     
	<code class="sql">
		USE EncryptionTest
		INSERT INTO Patients (PatientNumber,NHSNumber,Forename,Surname)
		VALUES
		('UR12345679','123456789','Bonza','Owl'),
		('UR22345679','223456789','Bonza','Hughes'),
		('UR32345679','323456789','Bonza','Davies'),
		('UR42345679','423456789','Bonza','Evans'),
		('UR52345679','523456789','Bonza','Parry'),
		('UR62345679','623456789','Bonza','Brown'),
		('UR72345679','723456789','Bonza','Williams'),
		('UR82345679','823456789','Bonza','Jones'),
		('UR92345679','923456789','Bonza','Bloggs');
	</code>
</pre>

Once I had the master key, certificate, and Symmetric Key in place I could go ahead and insert some dummy data into our patient's table.

### Convert

<pre>     
	<code class="sql">
		OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY Key1
		DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE Cert1
		GO
		UPDATE Patients
		SET 
			PatientNumber_Encrypted = EncryptByKey (KEY_GUID('Key1'),PatientNumber),
			NHSNumber_Encrypted = EncryptByKey (KEY_GUID('Key1'),NHSNumber),
			Forename_Encrypted = EncryptByKey (KEY_GUID('Key1'),Forename),
			Surname_Encrypted = EncryptByKey (KEY_GUID('Key1'),Surname)
		FROM 
			Patients
		GO
		CLOSE SYMMETRIC KEY Key1;
		GO
	</code>
</pre>

This is where the magic happens.

First I need to ask SQL Server to initialize the Symmetric Key, which is decrypted using the certificate I created.

Now I need to update the sensitive columns by encrypting the data and copying that encrypted data into the column marked &#8220;\_encrypted&#8221;

Once completed I need to tell SQL Server to close up the Symmetric Key.

As you can see, the data has been encrypted

### Drop & Roll

<pre>     
	<code class="sql">
		USE EncryptionTest
		GO
		ALTER TABLE Patients
		DROP COLUMN PatientNumber;
		GO
		ALTER TABLE Patients
		DROP COLUMN NHSNumber;
		GO
		ALTER TABLE Patients
		DROP COLUMN Forename;
		GO
		ALTER TABLE Patients
		DROP COLUMN Surname;
	</code>
</pre>

Now that the sensitive data has been encrypted, I can drop the plain text columns

### Let's Have A Read

<pre>     
	<code class="sql">
		OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY Key1
		DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE Cert1
		SELECT 
			CONVERT(varchar,decryptbykey(PatientNumber_Encrypted)) as 'PatientNumber',
			CONVERT(varchar,decryptbykey(NHSNumber_Encrypted)) as 'NHSNumber',
			CONVERT(varchar,decryptbykey(Forename_Encrypted)) as 'Forename',
			CONVERT(varchar,decryptbykey(Surname_Encrypted)) as 'Surname'
		FROM 
			Patients
		GO
		CLOSE SYMMETRIC KEY Key1
		GO
	</code>
</pre>

The above example shows how to read the data from the encrypted columns.

As you can see, the data is returned as expected.

### Insert Some More

<pre>     
	<code class="sql">
		OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY Key1
		DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE Cert1
		INSERT INTO Patients (PatientNumber_Encrypted,NHSNumber_Encrypted,Forename_Encrypted,Surname_Encrypted)
		VALUES
		(
		ENCRYPTBYKEY(Key_Guid('Key1'),CONVERT(varchar,'UR102345679')),ENCRYPTBYKEY(Key_Guid('Key1'),CONVERT(varchar,'103456789')),ENCRYPTBYKEY(Key_Guid('Key1'),CONVERT(varchar,'Bonza')),ENCRYPTBYKEY(Key_Guid('Key1'),CONVERT(varchar,'Doe')))
		GO
	</code>
</pre>

The above example shows how to go about adding more data into the encrypted columns.

![](/img/Encryption-Add-More-Data.png)

<pre>     
	<code class="sql">
		OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY Key1
		DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE Cert1
		SELECT 
			CONVERT(varchar,decryptbykey(PatientNumber_Encrypted)) as 'PatientNumber',
			CONVERT(varchar,decryptbykey(NHSNumber_Encrypted)) as 'NHSNumber',
			CONVERT(varchar,decryptbykey(Forename_Encrypted)) as 'Forename',
			CONVERT(varchar,decryptbykey(Surname_Encrypted)) as 'Surname'
		FROM 
			Patients
		GO
		CLOSE SYMMETRIC KEY Key1
		GO
	</code>
</pre>

Finally, using the above you can see that PatientNumber UR102345679 was added successfully, encrypted and read back by SQL Server.

Performance wise this would be extremely horrible, it isn't recommended to encrypt a primary key column, in production, there would be another column that would be the primary key and live within the index however this is for demonstration purposes only.

### Backup Them Keys

It is a really good idea to back up the certificate, you can do this easily with <a href="http://dbatools.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DbaTools</a>

<pre>     
	<code class="sql">
		Backup-DbaDBCertificate -SqlInstance localhost -Database EncryptionTest -Path C:\Temp\Certs -EncryptionPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -Force -AsPlainText StrongPassword123!)</</</code>
</pre>

In addition, you may want to back up the master key too

<pre>     
	<code class="powershell">
		Backup-DbaDBMasterKey -SqlInstance localhost -Database EncryptionTest -Path C:\Temp\Certs
	</code>
</pre>

This will prompt for a password, once provided, the master key will be backed up.
