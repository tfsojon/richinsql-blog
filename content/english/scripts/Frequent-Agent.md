This soloution will take logs for active SQL Agent Jobs and move them into a reporting table in your database of choice, when you have lots and lots of SQL Agent logs right clicking and selecting view history can take an age to load, having your logs somewhere else that you can index and manage will allow you to view the history of jobs directly from SSMS but also see what happened to a SQL Agent Job from a point in time in the past.
